# Troubleshooting-Master
In the Troubleshooting-Master pet project, I simulated various technical issues and created separate branches with corresponding Python scripts. Additionally, I created Troubleshooting Documentation, providing detailed insights into each scenario and the steps taken to resolve them. The integration of GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline automation ensured continuous testing and validation of code changes. This project exemplifies my expertise in handling intricate technical challenges.
